0.08    2016-02-16 (PERLANCAR)

	- Use lcpan stats-last-index-time subcommand (new in lcpan 0.74)
	  for faster way to check mirror's last index time.


0.07    2016-02-14 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Incompatible change] don't return naked result because it's not
	  flexible.

	- Nicer number formatting in error message about lcpan index being
	  too old.

0.06    2016-01-05 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [build] Re-build with updated Perinci::To::POD (0.70) which fixes

          'hash'.


0.04    2015-10-20 (PERLANCAR)

	- Fix/tweak Rinci metadata: add result_naked=>1. UPDATE 2016-02-14: this

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
